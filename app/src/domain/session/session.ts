/**
 * The teaching session, as a pure state machine. SPEC §6.3.
 *
 * ## Two phases
 *
 * **Introduction** shows every card once, front and back together — Spanish
 * word, German gloss, English beneath it, and the line from this song that
 * the gloss was disambiguated against. Two actions: `Weiter`, and `Ich kenne
 * das`, which SPEC calls essential because it is how you burn through the 40%
 * of words you already have. It marks the lemma known immediately and globally:
 * out of this session, and out of every future teach set in every song.
 *
 * **Recall** puts the Spanish front alone, waits for a tap, then takes one of
 * four FSRS grades. The session ends when every remaining card has been
 * answered `Gut` or better at least once.
 *
 * ## Why it returns effects instead of writing anything
 *
 * `introduce` and `grade` return `{ session, effects }`. The effects say what
 * must be persisted — a new known lemma, a graded card — and the app layer
 * commits them. Rule 3 keeps this file free of storage, and the payoff is that
 * the interrupted-session behaviour is testable without a database: a test can
 * take the session out of one step, feed it back into the next, and assert that
 * nothing was lost.
 *
 * ## The queue
 *
 * A plain round robin. `again` and `hard` send the card to the back; `good` and
 * `easy` retire it. No shuffling and no interval juggling — with at most 18
 * cards, "see it again in a moment" is all the ordering a session needs, and
 * FSRS owns the scheduling that actually matters, which is the one between
 * sessions. It is also deterministic, so no randomness has to be injected to
 * make the tests repeatable.
 *
 * ## Persistence
 *
 * `TeachingSession` is a plain data object with no methods and no class, so it
 * survives `structuredClone` into IndexedDB and comes back the same shape. The
 * caller writes it after every single answer. That is the whole interruption
 * story: a locked screen, a phone call or a killed tab resumes on the card it
 * stopped on, and a session is never restarted from the beginning.
