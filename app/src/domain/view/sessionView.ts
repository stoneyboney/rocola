/**
 * View model for the teaching session (SPEC §6.3).
 *
 * Rule 5: the screen renders this and works nothing out for itself. In
 * particular it does not decide which phase it is in, whether the answer is
 * showing, or what the progress numbers are — all of that is here, so that
 * porting the screen to SwiftUI is a rebuild of the layout and nothing more.
 *
 * No German in this file. `src/ui/format.ts` owns the copy so the domain layer
 * stays language-neutral for the port.
