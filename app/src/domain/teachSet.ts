/**
 * The SPEC §5 vocabulary selection rules, on device.
 *
 * This is the TypeScript twin of `molcajete-prep`'s `classify.py`, and the
 * third implementation will be Swift. Read that module's docstring alongside
 * this one — where the two deliberately differ it is written down below, and
 * where they agree they must keep agreeing.
 *
 * ## Why this runs on device at all
 *
 * Every bundle already carries a `teachSet` per chapter. It is a **hint for
 * display**, never the contents of a session. The pipeline computed it at prep
 * time against whatever known-set existed on the desktop that day; by the time
 * you open the chapter you have learned words it did not know about and marked
 * others with "Ich kenne das". Trusting it would re-teach words you know. So
 * the session recomputes from the chapter's own lemma counts against the live
 * known-set, and nothing in the app reads `Chapter.teachSet`.
 *
 * ## Three differences from the pipeline, all deliberate
 *
 * 1. **Closed-class parts of speech are never taught.** §5 as written makes 16
 *    of the first 18 cards of `las-noches-mejicanas` function words — `el`,
 *    `de`, `él`, `a`, `y`, `en`, `uno`, `que` — because `zipf >= 3.5` catches
 *    every one of them and `bookCount` sorts them to the top. A flashcard does
 *    not teach `de`; that is grammar, and it arrives from reading. They are
 *    still glossed, so the reader is unchanged.
 *
 * 2. **A lemma is taught where it occurs, not where it debuts.** The pipeline
 *    files each card under the lemma's `firstChapter`, which is the only thing
 *    it can do with no card store to consult. We have one. "Taught once" then
 *    falls out of `carded` on its own, and opening chapter 3 without having
 *    read chapter 0 teaches the chapter-0 vocabulary that chapter 3 reuses
 *    instead of leaving it merely underlined.
 *
 * 3. **The teach set comes back uncapped.** §5 Step 3's cap of 18 belongs to
 *    `segments.ts`, which is the only module that knows the number. Returning a
 *    capped list here would mean two places could disagree about it.
 *
 * ## Having a card and being known are different tests
 *
 * `known` is SPEC §7's definition — a matured card, or "Ich kenne das". `carded`
 * is merely "a card exists". A word first seen this morning is in `carded` but
 * not `known`: it must not be taught again, and it must not count towards
 * coverage either. Collapsing the two would do one or the other wrong.
