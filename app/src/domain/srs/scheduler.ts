/**
 * The scheduler. The only file in the app that imports `ts-fsrs`.
 *
 * SPEC §7 is unambiguous that FSRS does the scheduling and that we do not write
 * our own. This module is the seam that makes that instruction survive the Swift
 * port: everything above it speaks in `ReviewGrade` strings and `SrsCard`
 * records, and never sees `ts-fsrs`'s numeric `Rating`, its `State` enum or its
 * `FSRS` object. Porting means reimplementing this one file against whichever
 * FSRS package Swift has, and nothing else changes.
 *
 * `ts-fsrs` is pure computation with no dependencies and no DOM access, so
 * importing it here does not break CLAUDE.md rule 3.
 *
 * Two settings are pinned deliberately:
 *
 * - **`enable_fuzz: false`.** It is already the library default, but the default
 *   is not the point — fuzz randomises intervals, and rule 3 requires the domain
 *   layer to be deterministic. Turning it on would mean threading a seed through
 *   every call site to get repeatable tests, which is a large price for spacing
 *   out review load that a single-user app does not have.
 * - **`request_retention: 0.9`**, which is SPEC §7's stated target and also the
 *   library default. Written out rather than inherited, so that a change to the
 *   default in some future version is our decision and not an upgrade's.
