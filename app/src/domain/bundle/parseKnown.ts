/**
 * The other file the import button accepts: SPEC §8's `known.json`.
 *
 * A flat array of lemma strings, which is the shape `seed_known.py` writes and
 * the shape `molcajete-prep`'s `cli_seed.py` already reads. Three consumers
 * agreeing on "an array of strings" is the reason it is not something richer.
 *
 * Validated for the same reason a bundle is: the file arrives by AirDrop from
 * whatever version of the pipeline that desktop happens to be running, and a
 * half-valid seed is worse than none — a lemma wrongly marked known is never
 * taught *and* counts as covered, so the app would quietly skip words the
